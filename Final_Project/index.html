                        Have you ever craved Starbs, but couldn’t satisfy yourself because you’re broke? Have you ever gotten a waft of a chestnut praline latte in the air as you study at Starbucks, but had to resist a fifth coffee so you wouldn’t have to explain to your parents why you spent $30 on Starbucks in one day again? Well I have the solution for you! The Starbucks Secret Recipes book! For just $10, you can replicate over 60 Starbucks drinks and desserts for a fraction of the cost!

                        “The Starbucks Secret Recipes book is BAE! Like, I literally can’t even imagine going back to life without it!” -Maddie from Minnesota

                        “This book saved my marriage! Whenever my wife gets mad, she wants Starbs immediately to make her feel better. As you can imagine, this has been quite an expense in our marriage. That is, until I bought the Starbucks Secret Recipe Book! Now I just make her whatever drink she wants right in my kitchen, put it in a Starbucks cup I keep washing and reusing, and she hasn’t been able to tell the difference!” -Steve from Indiana
